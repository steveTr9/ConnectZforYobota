Hi,

_THERE ARE SEVERAL CLARIFICATIONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION_

1. HOW TO RUN

In order to run the file 'connectz.py', at first, you have to install the package listed int the file 'requirements.txt'.

Then, please make sure that you have your data file within the folder before running the file 'connectz.py'.

'connects.py' was written under Python3.7.

2. EXPLAINATION

This logic behind this solution was:

- 1. Create a virtual playing board as a X by Y zero matrix.

- 2. Scan data for each player's information, then fill the move into the board after it satisfies all the conditions expected. If there is no data left to scan, STOP and return the result.

- 3. Scan around the latest move for the solution.

- 4. If found, STOP and return the result.
	Else GO TO 2

You have a nice day.
